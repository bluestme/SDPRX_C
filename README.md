# The schedule of implementation

All newly written functions will be uploaded to the "upload folder" after completing each phase. We could use them to replace old functions in SDPR to gradually make it SDPRX. Once I have completed one, I will check the checkbox to show my progress

## Phase 0 Set up the environment

- [ ] Make sure that the complier works
- [ ] Make sure that default packages (such as GSL, fstream, sstream etc.) works on you computer

## Phase 1 Read in the data

## Phase 2 Data preprocessing

## Phase 3 Set up the state object and its initialization

## Phase 4 Set up the sampling functions
